# Mike Gerwitz at LoVullo Associates

Much of my personal configuration is shared [with my home PC][mtg-puppet];
if you are looking for generally useful configurations, you'll want to look
there.  This repository contains the stuff that differs; if you are not a
LoVullo employee, it is not likely to be all that useful in itself, but I
hope that someone will find something useful and worth exploring.

## Our Software
[LoVullo Associates][lovullo] is an excess-lines insurance agency in
Buffalo, New York.  You probably haven't heard of us; we deal only with
insurance brokers, and cannot advertise to the public.

Our software provides services primarily to brokers and internal users, much
of it web-based.  Even though most of it is insurance/accounting related,
you'd be surprised at the generality of most of the [free software][] that
we release: we have a lot going on, and there is a lot of infrastructure to
support it.  Most of that supporting software has nothing to do with
insurance; you may actually find some of it to be useful.

Do the projects that we have released interest you?  Are they something that
you would enjoy hacking or testing?  We [might be hiring][lovullo-hire].


## About Me
I am a [free software][] hacker, [activist][my-site], and [GNU
maintainer][].  I am the author of [GNU ease.js][easejs], a
[member][fsf-member] of the [Free Software Foundation][fsf], and
[write][me-papers] about software and freedoms as they relate to software
and technology.  I have a strong interest in compilers and the design and
history of programming languages.  I feel most at home at the command line
of a [GNU/Linux operating system][gnu].

If you wish to contact me about something unrelated to a specific project
being developed at LoVullo Associates, please use the e-mail address listed
in my profile, *not* my work e-mail address that appears in (most of) the
Git commits for those projects.

are not necessarily a reflection of my personal philosophies/ideologies, or

I work on free software projects both inside and outside of work, and the
