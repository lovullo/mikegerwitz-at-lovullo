# Mike Gerwitz's LoVullo-Specific Desktop Configuration

Much of my personal configuration is shared [with my home PC][mtg-puppet];
if you are looking for generally useful configurations, you'll want to look
there.  This repository contains the stuff that differs; if you are not a
LoVullo employee, it is not likely to be all that useful in itself, but I
hope that someone will find something useful and worth exploring.
