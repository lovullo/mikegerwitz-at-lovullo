# My box never goes down intentionally, unless I'm performing a kernel
# update, which is infrequent.  However, since my GNU/Linux box is
# virtualized within Windoze, it is at the mercy of an unstable environment.
# Shit therefore happens.  And it pisses me off.
#
# This at least automates some of the manual stuff needed to help me
# continue where I left off.  Right now, it is modest---it will automate
# further in the future, but hopefully I do not need to use this often.
