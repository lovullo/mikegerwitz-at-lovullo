# This is an important security feature just in case my secure script
# (usually run at the end of the day) is not run, or some other problem
# arises.  If an attacker is able to somehow access a session that has
# access to the SSH agent, we do not want them to be able to push code to
# GitHub or access any [personal] servers that I may have put the key on.
#
# This is intended to limit the key duration to the hours that I am
# physically present in the office.
#
# Note that my `afd' script also purges the key from memory when I leave my
# desk.
# #

# if the encrypted dir isn't mounted, then we have to do that first (this will
# simply exit immediately if there is nothing to be done)

# add the SSH key for the remainder of the work day (+1h to ensure we never
